      <PDescription>
        We were once gamers just like you. Every button push, every tactical
        choice, and every move was in tune with the game. We flourished in the
        exciting realm of Esports, discovering virtual worlds and showcasing our
        prowess in constantly changing arenas. But as time went on, we became
        patrons instead than participants.

      <PDescription>
        We hoped for a opportunity that would combine our love of gaming and
        professional development throughout our gaming adventure. But as Esports
        was still in its infancy, no such path had yet been created.

        Now that we are in a position to do so, we can provide gamers like you
        the chance to channel their abilities and enthusiasm into entering the
        world of Esports.
